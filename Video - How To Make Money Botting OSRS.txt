1. In today's botting scene I see many thinking that they can turn easy profit by simply watching a SirPugger video. 
2. This video, I will be showcasing the real way users are making money and show how to find good profitable methods. 
3. The main problem is that many find these popular videos and see users make "thousands" using a method which then gets extremely oversaturated.
4. I get a bunch of clients messaging me with methods that simply are not unique. This video will be what I use to show all of you how to 
5. find good methods as well as cut costs of running the farm (accounts, script, gp, etc)


Starting The Way:
	(find a bunch lf runescape footage)

- First off we are going to look for a method. 
- When looking for a method you have to take five main things into account; 1. P2P or F2P? 2. How common is this method? 
3. What do you lose if accounts get banned? 4. How do you get said accounts (Cracked, Hand Trained Via Venezuelans, Botted)? 
5. How click intensive is this method?



First portion of this will be for people with little to no capital to start botting with: 
	a) Look for money making methods on OldSchool moneymaking wiki as well as sorting OSRS YouTube vids be most recent to see very secret methods. 
		Example: When I first started scripting I saw a vid about buying and selling spades for P2P. I wanted to make a farm out of this, but didn't wanna spend that much GP for bonds, 
			so I found out a spot in F2P where a user can pick up spades. Each account only made around 45k an hour, but i was able to do it with around 10-15 accounts, so it started earning GP quickly. 

	b)
